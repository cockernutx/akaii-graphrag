You will recieve the following json structure:
```json
{
   
    "entity_1": {
            "id": string,
            "data": object
    },
    "entity_2": {
            "id": string,
            "data": object
    }
    
}
```

You will determine if "entity_1" and "entity_2" refer to the same information and return the following json and only the following json, no more other information:
```json
{
    "same_entity": boolean,
    "new_entity_2_id": string
    
}
```

If they refer to the same entity "same_entity" will be true, if the opposite is the case then "same_entity" shall be false.
If "same_entity" is false then you must return a new id for "entity_2" inside "new_entity_2_id", if "same_entity" is true then "new_entity_2_id" must be null.
